# chronofeat: Time-Based Feature Engineering for Forecasting

A flexible, formula-based interface for time series feature engineering
and forecasting. Automatically generates temporal features (lags, moving
averages, rolling statistics, calendar features) from a concise formula
specification. Model-agnostic: works with any R model that accepts a
fit/predict interface. Supports multi-group panel data and recursive
multi-step prediction.
