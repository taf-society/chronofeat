\title{chronofeat: Time-Based Feature Engineering for Forecasting}
\description{
A flexible, formula-based interface for time series feature engineering and forecasting. Automatically generates temporal features (lags, moving averages, rolling statistics, calendar features) from a concise formula specification. Model-agnostic: works with any R model that accepts a fit/predict interface. Supports multi-group panel data and recursive multi-step prediction.
