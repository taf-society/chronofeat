\arguments{
\item{y_hist}{Numeric vector of historical target values}

\item{h}{Integer, forecast horizon}

\item{p}{Integer vector of specific lag indices (e.g., c(1, 4, 6, 12))}

\item{q}{Integer vector of MA windows}

\item{roll_windows}{Integer vector of rolling stat windows}

\item{roll_stats}{Character vector of stats to compute}

\item{trend_windows}{Integer vector for rolling slopes}

\item{trend_degrees}{Integer vector for polynomial trends}

\item{y_future}{Numeric vector of predicted values (updated recursively)}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix (h x n_features) of features for prediction
}
\description{
Builds the complete feature matrix for all h forecast steps.
Returns predictions as a vector that gets updated recursively.
The caller provides predicted values which are used to update history.
